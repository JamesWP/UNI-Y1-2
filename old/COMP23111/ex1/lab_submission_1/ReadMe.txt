INTRODUCTION
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

This ReadMe file contains instructions on how to organize and submit
your COMP23111 coursework for marking.

The marking in COMP23111 is done off-line, i.e., it is not
face-to-face with a TA, on a workstation, at a lab session, as in
other courses you have taken in your degree programme so far.

In the case of COMP23111, you must instead submit your work through
the Moodle course unit web page, using the submission link for each
lab exercise that we make available there.

Keep reading to understand in more detail what we expect you to do.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------
WHAT OTHER FILES AND FOLDER ACCOMPANY THIS ReadME FILE
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

This ReadMe file was found inside a folder called 'lab_submission_N' as
a result of your having unzipped the following file:

     /opt/info/courses/COMP23111/lab_submission_N.zip

Unzipping it has created the following structure:
 
lab_submission_N
  |___ COMP23111_14_Lab_Exercise_N_FirstName_LastName.tex (file)
  |___ ReadMe.txt (file)
  |___ diagrams (dir)  
  |___ sqlOutputs (dir)
  |___ sqlScripts (dir)
  
Here's an explanation of what these folders and files contain and
mean.
  
(1) COMP23111_14_Lab_Exercise_N_FirstName_LastName.tex: This file is a
		LaTeX template.

		The lab exercises require you to generate a report
		using LaTex and outputting PDF, which is then part of
		submission (see below). You will place the .tex file
		for your report in a similar folder to this with an
		appropriately modified name.

(2) ReadMe.txt: This file is *this file*.

(3) diagrams:   This folder contains an example .dia diagram and the
		corresponding .eps (Encapsulated PostScript) export
		that you can generate using File -> Export [select
		'Encapsulated Postscript' format] function in Dia.
		(There are two versions of .eps, either will do.) 

		If the lab exercise requires you to generate diagrams,
		you will place them in a similar folder to this with
		an appropriately modified name.			 

(2) sqlOutputs: This folder contains an example .lst file. Such a file
		is generated by SQL*Plus under the control of the
		SPOOL command and basically results from redirecting
		formatted input and output onto the file.

		This folder is meant for storing the result of running
		SQL scripts (for one example, see 'sqlScripts', below).

		The lab exercises require you to generate such
		formatted output by running the SQL script(s) that you
		will have prepared during your work in the lab. You
		will place the .lst files in a similar folder to this
		with an appropriately modified name.

(3) sqlScripts: This contains an example SQL script (a .sql file)
		containing SQL*Plus commands and SQL statements that
		can be run with the START command. 

		If you, as will you do, run a SQL script, while
		SPOOLing to a .lst file, you will obtain a result such
		as would go into the 'sqlOutputs' folder (see above).

		The lab exercises require you to generate SQL scripts
		and you will place the .sql file(s) in a similar
		folder to this with an appropriately modified name.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------
WHAT EACH SUBMISSION WILL CONSIST OF
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

For each lab exercise, when you submit your coursework for marking,
Moodle will ask you to submit *two* (and *only two*) files, as
follows:

	(1) A report, which is what we will mark. This must be written
	    in LaTeX, using the template we provide (see above) to
	    produce a PDF document. You *don't submit the .tex* file
	    separately, rather *you _must_ submit the PDF file*
	    generated using the 'pdflatex' command as explained below.

	(2) A .zip file that is a compressed archive of the folder
	    where you will organize the outcome of your work on a
	    given lab exercise and that we will need for reference
	    purposes in marking the report and for auditing
	    malpractice, if needed.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------
HOW TO GO ABOUT DOING YOUR WORK FOR THE EXERCISES
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

Before you start doing any actual work, you should copy the folder
produced by the zipped file, i.e., 'lab_submission_N', renaming the
resulting copy to make the 'N' to correspond to the lab exercise number
in hand.

You will later use this folder to place the items you will need to
submit.

Then, finally, comes the actual work. 

We suggest that most of the time you mostly work using a text editor
to prepare SQL*Plus commands and SQL statements, as appropriate, and
then, through copying-and-pasting try them out in the SQL*Plus command
line interface.

In the beginning, you will make mistakes, of course. You then make
changes in the text editor and try again, in very much a debugging
frame-of-mind.

Once you got it right, for each such piece of work in the lab
specifications, you will have obtained a step in the SQL script that
we ask you to submit, so you may wish to save/append it to an
appropriately named .sql file in the appropriate folder. This SQL
script file will then grow to include all the working bits of your
submission.

After the SQL script file is ready, then you can run it under SPOOLing
to produce the .lst file that will get submitted too.

Now, the above process is just an idea for you to consider. In
practice, you should use your common sense and knowledge of both
computing and the available tools to find out what, in the detail of
it, works best for you

Once you have a full script and the corresponding spool file (and, in
some cases, the .dia and .eps diagram files), then you need to prepare
the report and the submission.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------
PREPARING THE FILES FOR SUBMISSION
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
				 
(1) In the 'lab_submission_N' folder, locate the template file

    COMP23111_14_Lab_Exercise_N_FirstName_LastName.tex 

    and rename it by changing the substring 'N' into the corresponding
    lab exercise number and changing both the 'FirstName' and
    'LastName' substrings to your first name and your last name,
    respectively.

(2) Open this renamed file using favourite text editor in Linux.

(3) Edit the file to refer to the formatted output (.lst) that you
    have created. An example is provided. Look for the following line

    \includesqloutput{sqlOutputs/LabExNOut.lst}

    and change it accordingly. Notice the path expression otherwise
    you will get a LaTeX compile error.

(3) Edit the file to include any graphic files. Remember to export
    your Dia diagrams to .eps format using the File -> Export [select
    'Encapsulated Postscript' format] function in Dia. An example is
    provided that shows how figures are included. Look for the
    following line:

    \centerline{\includegraphics[width=0.75\textwidth]{diagrams/example.eps}}

    Notice the path expression otherwise you will get a LaTeX compile
    error. Also, notice the reduction factor (0.75) in \textwidth: if
    the figure doesn't print, or doesn't look, right, i.e., legible
    and clear, try adjusting the reduction factor in the line above.

(4) Now, for the report writing proper. Whenever and wherever needed,
    add text as guided by the lab exercise specifications, i.e., the
    report properly speaking also contains textual answers,
    explanations, discussion, etc..

(5) Save the .tex file. Then, on a terminal and from the right point
    in the file system, run the following command (of course, using
    the name of *your* file) so that LaTeX generates the .pdf that is
    your submittable report:

    $ pdflatex --shell-escape COMP23111_14_Lab_Exercise_N_FirstName_LastName.tex

    Recall that sometimes your will need to run the command above more
    than once to update, e.g., page numbering etc. Also, make sure that
    you use the --shell-escape argument.

    The PDF file thus generated will be called 

    COMP23111_14_Lab_Exercise_N_FirstName_LastName.pdf

    (again, with the appropriate modifications) and is *one* of the
    files that you must submit to Moodle.

(6) Finally, generate a .zip file that archives your working folder
    for this exercise, created as described above. This will then
    contain, among others, the SQL scripts (i.e., .sql) used to
    generate the SQL*Plus formatted output files (i.e., .lst) and the
    original and exported diagram files (i.e., .dia, .eps) that we
    need for reference and for auditing malpractice.

    Running the following command (of course, using the name of *your*
    folder), probably one level up in the file system from where you
    issued the LaTeX compilation command, would do what you need.:

	$ zip -r lab_submission_N.zip lab_submission_N

-------------------------------------------------------------------------
HOW TO SUBMIT
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

To submit your work, go to the Moodle webpage for the course unit, and
click on the submission link for the appropriate lab exercise.

You will be required to submit two files: 

    - one is the report (the PDF document),

    - the other is the archived folder (the zip file within which we
      can find the SQL scripts and diagrams we need for reference).

We hope you enjoy doing the lab and learning a lot! Good Luck!
